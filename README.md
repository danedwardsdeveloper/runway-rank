# runway-rank

A full-stack web app that ranks fashion looks using the Elo algorithm. Created with Express and Vue, and written in TypeScript. This site aims to be a much kinder version of the site that inspired it: FaceMash by Mark Zuckerberg. I recommend watching The Social Network, which is a surprisingly good film about the story of Facebook (and one of [MetaCritic's Top 100 Films](https://metacritic100.com/))
